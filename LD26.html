<p>You play as an exotic lifeform (the blue one!) made of Energy. Everything is Energy!</p>
<p>Each turn you choose one of the following actions</p>
<p>Exploring. This costs you 1 unit of Energy, but allows you to see what the world around you is like. You like it because you can start planning how to take over the world.</p>
<p>Expanding. This costs you 1 unit of Energy, but you can take control of a spot you previously Explored. You will have to fight for it, spending as many units of Energy as there is Energy and Generators on your target.</p>
<p>Generating. This one feels good. You will generate 1 unit of Energy for each Generator that you activated. Mmm, yummy!</p>
<p>Additionally at the end of a turn, you will have to offset your current actions by either spreading your new Energy across your body or consuming Energy from your body.</p>
<p>The game will continuously hint at what items are currently available.</p>
<p>You and your two ennemies will take turns until either you die of a shortage of Energy, or both of your ennemies suffer such a sad fate. Fortunately, these two guys are currently very stupid...</p>
